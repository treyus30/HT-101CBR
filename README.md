# HT-101CBR
## Uploading Binaries (.hex)
This program is built on ATmega328 platform, mainly the Arduino Nano, though it should work without any port work with the Uno as well. 
I'm keeping the source code private for now for various reasons, so you will be flashing the releases as a pre-compiled binary directly onto the device. The easiest way to do this is Xloader. (https://github.com/binaryupdates/xLoader)

Save the zip file somewhere accessible, run Xloader.exe, and select the correct device and Hex file.

Make sure your Arduino is plugged in, and COM port is known and set. Then click Upload.
